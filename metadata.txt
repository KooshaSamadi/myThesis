for japanstocksticker => i used market cap over 2B and volume over 100k
for s&p500 => i fetched all the data since end of 2022 daily but for
 50min since it gave the last 730 days i just fetched those so i have 
 not split the training and test data
for france 31=> market cap over 1b and volume over 1m



I used this code to extract the list of the ticker from yahoo finance
const nodes = document.querySelectorAll('span.symbol');

// 2. Pull out (and trim) their text
const symbols = Array.from(nodes, n => n.textContent.trim());

// 3. Show them in the console
console.log(symbols);
